ETHICS IN GOVERNMENT ACT
PERIODIC TRANSACTION REPORT FORM AND
INSTRUCTIONS

Instruction Guide and Form for Completing
Ethics In Government Act Periodic Transaction Reports
Members, officers, and employees who
qualify as “senior staff” under the Ethics in
Government Act of 1978 are required to file
Periodic Transaction Reports (PTRs or
Reports). In general, you must report on a PTR
each purchase, sale, or exchange involving
stocks, bonds, commodities futures, or
other securities (e.g., cryptocurrencies)
owned by you, your spouse, or your
dependent child when the amount of the
transaction exceeds $1,000. For sales
transactions, the $1,000 threshold is based on
the total dollar value of the transaction, not
your gain or loss made on the sale.
Note: If you, your spouse, or your
dependent
children
do
not
have
reportable transactions, no PTR is
required (although some transactions
may be reportable on your annual FD).
Purchase transactions which must be
disclosed include:
• Individual purchases involving an asset
listed above in which the transaction
amount exceeds $1,000; or
• Reinvestment of income (such as dividends
or interest) in a reportable asset in which
the amount of the reinvestment transaction
exceeds $1,000.
Sale transactions which must be
disclosed are:
• Individual sales involving an asset in which
the transaction amount exceeds $1,000.

Where only a portion of an asset is sold (e.g., half
of your shares in Mega Corporation), please
check the “Partial Sale” box.
Exchange transactions are somewhat
rare and refer only to limited circumstances.
One set of circumstances involves the exchange
of stock certificates following the purchase of
one company by another or a merger of two
companies. Please consult with Committee
staff for further guidance.

You are not required to report on a
PTR any transactions in a widely held
investment fund (e.g., a mutual fund) if:
1. You neither exercise control over nor
have the ability to exercise control
over the financial interests held by the
fund, and
2. (a) The fund is publicly traded; or
(b) The assets of the fund are widely
diversified.
A fund is widely diversified if it both:
1. Holds no more than 5% of the value of its
portfolio in the securities of any issuer
(other than the U.S. government), and
2. Holds no more than 20% of the value of
its portfolio in any particular economic
sector or geographic region.
Further explanation of these terms is available
in the “Instruction Guide for Completing
Financial Disclosure Statements and Periodic
Transaction Reports” available on the
Committee website:
https://ethics.house.gov.
Note: Transactions in these assets must
still be reported on your annual FD Statement.
Purchase
and
sale
transactions
involving assets held within self-directed
retirement accounts such as 401(k) plans
and IRAs must be disclosed. For example, if
you have a 401(k) plan and direct the plan
administrator to sell or purchase stocks, bonds,
or other securities, you must separately
disclose on a PTR each of these transactions
valued over $1,000. Transfers between
currently-held assets within these accounts are
also considered purchase and sale transactions
for financial disclosure purposes. These types of
transfers are commonly referred to as
reallocation or rebalancing of funds.
The reporting threshold for disclosure of
transactions is reached when the gross amount
of a single purchase or sale transaction

exceeds $1,000. This includes transactions that
result in a net loss. Thus, a sale transaction of
an asset for $5,000 for which you previously
paid $7,000 must be disclosed even though it
resulted in a $2,000 net loss.
Partnership Transactions. You are only
required to disclose transactions related to the
ownership interests in partnerships and
limited liability companies that were formed for
the purpose of holding investments. If, for
example, you are a partner in a limited
partnership that transacted in five stocks, you
must separately disclose each transaction for
which your interest exceeds $1,000.
Column-by-Column Instructions
IPO Check Box. You must indicate
whether you were allocated any shares to
purchase in an Initial Public Offering by
checking the appropriate box.
SP/DC/JT Ownership Column. You
may, but are not required to, indicate that a
transaction involves an asset that is held by
your spouse or dependent child, or is jointly
held, by including an “SP” for spouse, “DC” for
dependent child, or “JT” for jointly held
property. If you use this distinction on your
annual FD Statement, please use it on your
PTR.
Asset Column. Provide the complete name
of the asset for which a reportable transaction
has occurred. Do not use ticker symbols.
Type of Transaction Column. Indicate
the type of transaction (purchase, sale, or
exchange) by placing an “X” in the appropriate
box.
Date of Transaction Column. Indicate
the month, day, and year of the transaction. For
securities, the transaction date is generally the
date the security was traded.

Date Notified of Transaction Column.
Indicate the month, day, and year that you
were notified of the transaction.
Amount of Transaction Column. Report the
category of value of the total purchase price or
total sale price (or the fair market value in the
case of an exchange) of the transaction. As
explained above, use the gross amount of a
transaction to determine which value category
amount to disclose. The amount of any capital
gain or loss on the transaction is irrelevant for
the purposes of determining the transaction
amount. The column “Transaction in a Spouse
or Dependent Child Asset over $1,000,000”
should only be used for assets that are owned
by your spouse or dependent child, in which you
have no interest.
You may not send brokerage statements
in lieu of completing, or as an attachment
to, the PTR form.
Exclusions

The following transactions are not required
to be disclosed on a PTR:
• Any transaction in real property;
• The purchase or sale of any widely held
investment fund that is either publicly
traded or widely diversified and is not
controlled by the filer;
• Any transaction in a mutual fund or
Exchange Traded Fund (ETF);
• Any transactions solely by and between
you, your spouse, or your dependent child;
• Any transaction in a federal retirement
program, such as the Thrift Savings
Plan (TSP);
• Stock splits;
• Bequests or inheritances;
• The opening or closing of bank or similar

accounts (such as money market funds), or
deposits or withdrawals from a bank
account;

• The purchase or sale of certificates of

deposit; and

• The rollover of assets from one retirement

account to another.

Note: You may still be required to report
some of these transactions on your annual
FD Statement.
Signature
You must sign and date the signature page
after completing the PTR. By your signature,
you are certifying that the report is accurate
and complete to the best of your knowledge and
belief. Additionally, you are certifying that, to
date, you have disclosed all transactions as
required by the STOCK Act. This page must be
signed by you personally, not by someone acting
on your behalf, even if someone else prepared or
assisted you in completing the Report.
Due Date of Filing
A PTR must be filed by the earlier of these
two dates: (a) 30 days from being made aware of
the transaction or (b) 45 days from the
transaction. PTR deadlines will not be extended
to the following business day if the original due
date falls on a weekend or federal holiday. If the
deadline falls on a holiday or weekend, the PTR
can still be timely filed through the online filing
system that day, but if a filer submits the PTR
using the paper form, it must be received by the
Clerk or legibly postmarked by the last business
day before the holiday or weekend.
Extensions will not be granted for PTRs.
A $200 penalty shall be assessed against
anyone who files more than 30 days late.
Where to File and Number of Copies
The PTR (and any amendments) must be
filed with the Clerk of the House of
Representatives, Legislative Resource Center,
Room B-81 Cannon House Office Building,

Washington, DC. 20515. Members should
submit one original (with an original signature)
and two photocopies of their completed and
signed Report. Officers and employees should
submit one original (with an original signature)
and one photocopy of their completed and
signed Report.
Getting Assistance
Filers are encouraged to carefully read these
instructions. Any filer who has questions
concerning the reporting requirements or how
to fill out the PTR should call the Committee
at
(202) 225–7103. Additional copies of the form
can be obtained by visiting the Committee
website at https://ethics.house.gov and clicking
on the “Financial Disclosure” tab. If you would
like additional information about financial
disclosure requirements generally, it can be
found in the Instruction Guide, also available
on the website.
Note: PTRs are required by the Ethics
in Government Act of 1978, as amended.
The reports will be available to the public
and will be reviewed by the Committee on
Ethics or its designee. Any individual who
knowingly and willfully falsifies, or who
knowingly and willfully fails to file a PTR
may be subject to civil penalties and
criminal sanctions. See section 104 of the
Ethics in Government Act (5 U.S.C. app.
§§ 101-111) and 18 U.S.C. § 1001.
