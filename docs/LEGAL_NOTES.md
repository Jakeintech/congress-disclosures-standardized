## Additional Context

### Senate Financial Disclosures

The Senate Select Committee on Ethics provides similar guidance in their financial disclosure instructions:

> "It is unlawful for any person to obtain or use a report for: (1) any unlawful purpose; (2) any commercial purpose, other than by news and communications media for dissemination to the general public; (3) determining or establishing the credit rating of any individual; or (4) use, directly or indirectly, in the solicitation of money for any political, charitable, or other purpose."

### House Filing Deadlines

The Ethics in Government Act requires reports to be made public within **30 days of filing**. The House Clerk's office maintains the official repository at:

**https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/FinancialDisclosure**

### Public Records vs. Privacy

While financial disclosure reports are **public records** by law, the statute explicitly limits how they may be used. This reflects a balance between:

- **Transparency**: Public has a right to know about potential conflicts of interest
- **Privacy**: Members retain some protection against commercial exploitation and harassment
