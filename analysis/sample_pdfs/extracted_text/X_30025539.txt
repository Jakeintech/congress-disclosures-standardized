Clerk of the House of Representatives • Legislative Resource Center • B81 Cannon Building • Washington, DC 20515
Candidates who are required to file a Financial Disclosure Statement (FD) under the Ethics in Government Act are permitted by federal law
to request an extension of up to 90 days, but in all cases, the extension must result in a due date that is at least 30 days before an election in
which they are a candidate. Filers may request an extension for their FD by filing this form on or before the applicable filing deadline. An
FD filed under such an extension is not considered late. However, by law, an individual who files a report more than 30 days after it is due
without having received an extension must pay a $200 late filing fee.
